🔍 Project: Zomato Restaurant Analysis (Power BI)
Tools Used: Power BI (No maps used)
Skills Applied: Data Visualization, Dashboard Design, Business Analysis

🧩 Problem Statement (In My Words)
Zomato has a massive amount of data from different countries about restaurants, cuisines, ratings, online delivery, and other features. The goal was to create a dashboard that could help explore this data in a meaningful way—helping identify trends in customer preferences, service availability, and restaurant performance. My task was to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that presents all this information clearly, without using any map visuals.

📊 Dashboard Breakdown (How I Designed It and What It Shows)
✅ KPI Cards (Top-Level Summary)
At the top of the dashboard, I added big number cards that instantly give the user a sense of the scale of the data:

9551 Restaurants – Total restaurants in the dataset.

250 Cuisines – Variety of food types offered.

15 Countries and 141 Cities – Shows Zomato’s international coverage.

1M Votes – Number of user reviews collected.

2.89 Avg Rating – Average rating across all restaurants.

These KPIs are great for giving a quick overview before diving into the deeper insights.

🎚️ Slicer Panel (On the Left)
I added a Country Filter slicer so users can interact with the dashboard and drill down into data for a specific country (like India, Australia, UK, etc.).
This makes the dashboard dynamic and personalized—every chart updates based on the selected country.

🌆 City-wise Restaurant Count (Line Chart)
This chart shows the number of restaurants in each city.
From this, we can clearly see which cities have the most Zomato listings—New Delhi, Gurgaon, and Noida are on top.
👉 Insight: Helps identify high-density regions where Zomato has a strong presence.

🍔 Cuisines & Average Rating by Restaurant (Combo Bar + Line Chart)
Here I combined two things:

Bar Chart shows how many cuisines each major restaurant chain offers (e.g., Subway, Domino’s, McDonald's).

Line Graph shows their average rating.

👉 Insight: McDonald's has the highest average rating (3.36), even though Subway offers more variety. This can help in understanding both customer satisfaction and menu diversity.

🍽️ Table Booking (Donut Chart)
This shows how many restaurants support table booking.

A large portion (~8.3K) do not offer booking.
👉 Insight: There’s a potential to improve user experience by encouraging more restaurants to support table reservations.

🚚 Online Delivery (Pie Chart)
Shows the count of restaurants offering delivery.

Most restaurants (7.1K) offer online delivery, which reflects Zomato’s strong delivery presence.
👉 Insight: Delivery is clearly a major focus area for Zomato.

🥘 Cuisine-Wise Count of Restaurants (Bar Chart)
This visual ranks cuisines based on how many restaurants serve them:

North Indian, Chinese, and Fast Food are the top 3.
👉 Insight: These cuisine types are the most popular and widely available.

💡 What Makes This Dashboard Useful
It’s clean, interactive, and doesn’t rely on map visuals.

It’s easy to understand and packed with useful insights for business decisions.

Anyone using it—Zomato’s marketing, operations, or strategy teams—can get both high-level and deep insights about restaurant behavior, customer preferences, and service coverage.
